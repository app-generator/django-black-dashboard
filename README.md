<br />

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd apps/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br /> 

## Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

### [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/)
---

Waitress (Gunicorn equivalent for Windows) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install waitress
```
> Start the app using [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html)

```bash
$ waitress-serve --port=8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
